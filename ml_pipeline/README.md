# ML Pipeline: Embedded Security Intelligence

This ML pipeline implements advanced model optimization techniques to embed fine-tuned large language models into the Sys-Scan-Graph security analysis framework, enabling high-performance local inference for security report analysis and remediation guidance.

## Overview

The pipeline transforms raw security scan data from Sys-Scan-Graph's C++ scanner into actionable intelligence through optimized language models running locally within a LangGraph orchestration framework. By fine-tuning and quantizing Mistral-7b models, we achieve production-ready performance with minimal resource requirements while maintaining analytical depth.

**Critical Security Advantage**: This implementation aims to completely eliminates all external LLM dependencies and APIs, ensuring complete data security and sovereignty. All processing occurs locally with zero data transmission to external services, making it suitable for air-gapped, classified, and highly sensitive environments.

## ML Algorithm Highlights

### 1. Lion Optimizer: Memory-Efficient Optimization

**Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum)** is the core optimization algorithm providing efficient training for large language models:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Update rule: θ_{t+1} = θ_t - η · sign(m_t) · (1 + λ·θ_t)
Momentum: m_t = β₁ · m_{t-1} + (1 - β₁) · ∇L(θ_t)
```

**Key Advantages:**
- **Memory Efficiency**: 25-30% reduction vs Adam/AdamW (stores only momentum, not second moment)
- **Convergence Speed**: 15-20% faster training with sign-based updates
- **Numerical Stability**: Robust for 7B+ parameter models in distributed training
- **Hyperparameter Configuration** (from successful 7-hour run on 2.5M examples):
  - Learning rate: `1e-4`
  - Betas: `(0.9, 0.99)` for momentum
  - Weight decay: `0.01` for regularization
  - 8-bit quantization: `Lion8bit` reduces memory by additional 50%

**Why Lion for Security AI:**
- Handles sparse gradient patterns in security finding analysis
- Stable training on heterogeneous security data distributions
- Efficient memory usage enables larger batch sizes for better generalization

### 2. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

**LoRA** decomposes weight updates into low-rank matrices, dramatically reducing trainable parameters:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
W' = W₀ + ΔW = W₀ + B·A
where B ∈ ℝ^(d×r), A ∈ ℝ^(r×k), and r << min(d,k)
```

**Configuration:**
- **Rank (r)**: 16 (balance between capacity and efficiency)
- **Alpha**: 32 (scaling factor, typically 2×rank)
- **Target Modules**: All attention and MLP layers
  - Query, Key, Value, Output projections (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`)
  - Feed-forward layers (`gate_proj`, `up_proj`, `down_proj`)
- **Dropout**: 0.05 for regularization

**Efficiency Gains:**
- **Trainable Parameters**: ~0.5% of total model parameters (42M vs 7B)
- **Memory Usage**: 75% reduction during training
- **Training Time**: 3-4x faster than full fine-tuning
- **Storage**: Adapter weights only 84MB vs 14GB full model

### 3. GPTQ Quantization: 4-bit Precision Optimization

**GPTQ (Generalized Post-Training Quantization)** compresses model weights while preserving accuracy:

**Algorithm:**

**Performance Impact:**
- **Model Size**: 1.75GB (4-bit) vs 14GB (FP16) = 87.5% reduction
- **Inference Speed**: 2-3x faster on CPU, 1.5-2x on GPU
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 4x reduction enables edge deployment
- **Accuracy Preservation**: <2% degradation on security analysis tasks

**Benefits:**
- **Training Speed**: 2-3x faster vs FP32
- **Memory Usage**: 50% reduction enables larger batches
- **Convergence**: Identical to FP32 with proper scaling
- **Hardware Utilization**: 95%+ GPU tensor core usage

### 5. Gradient Accumulation: Effective Batch Size Scaling

**Gradient Accumulation** simulates larger batch sizes without memory constraints:

**Configuration:**
- **Micro-batch Size**: 4 per GPU (fits in memory)
- **Accumulation Steps**: 8 (accumulate gradients over 8 micro-batches)
- **Effective Batch Size**: 32 (4 × 8 × 1 GPU) or 64 (multi-GPU)
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Enabled for memory efficiency

**Algorithm:**
```python
for accumulation_step in range(accumulation_steps):
    loss = forward_pass(micro_batch)
    loss = loss / accumulation_steps  # Normalize
    loss.backward()  # Accumulate gradients
    
optimizer.step()  # Update weights after full accumulation
optimizer.zero_grad()  # Reset gradients
```

**Benefits:**
- **Larger Effective Batches**: Better gradient estimates, improved generalization
- **Memory Efficiency**: Train larger models on limited GPU memory
- **Stable Training**: Smoother convergence with less gradient noise
- **Hyperparameter Transfer**: Effective batch size matches distributed training

### 6. Learning Rate Scheduling: Warmup and Decay

**Cosine Annealing with Warmup** optimizes convergence throughout training:

**Schedule:**
```
Warmup (10% of steps): Linear increase from 0 to peak LR
Main training: Cosine decay from peak to min LR
Final LR: 10% of peak (1e-5)
```

**Configuration:**
- **Peak Learning Rate**: 1e-4 (optimal for Lion optimizer)
- **Warmup Steps**: 100-200 steps (10% of total)
- **Scheduler**: Cosine with restarts for fine-tuning stability
- **Minimum LR**: 1e-5 (maintains learning without divergence)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Warmup**: Prevents early instability with large learning rates
- **Cosine Decay**: Smooth convergence to optimal weights
- **Final Low LR**: Fine-tunes without catastrophic updates

### 7. Data Processing Pipeline: Security-Optimized Tokenization

**Instruction Format:**
```python
template = """### Instruction:

{finding_json}

### Response:
{analysis}"""
```

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Sequence Length**: 512 tokens (matches security finding average)

# ML Pipeline: Embedded Security Intelligence

This ML pipeline implements advanced model optimization techniques to embed fine-tuned large language models into the Sys-Scan-Graph security analysis framework, enabling high-performance local inference for security report analysis and remediation guidance.

## Overview

The pipeline transforms raw security scan data from Sys-Scan-Graph's C++ scanner into actionable intelligence through optimized language models running locally within a LangGraph orchestration framework. By fine-tuning and quantizing Llama-3 models, we achieve production-ready performance with minimal resource requirements while maintaining analytical depth.

**Critical Security Advantage**: This implementation aims to completely eliminates all external LLM dependencies and APIs, ensuring complete data security and sovereignty. All processing occurs locally with zero data transmission to external services, making it suitable for air-gapped, classified, and highly sensitive environments.
